**Corvus** delivers an open-source, transparent, and auditable Infrastructure Security Automation Platform. It's currently in heavy development.
The platform is built on top of Golang and Rust for its core components.

## Adopters

Since we are still in heavy development, we have no discloseable adopters but on our internal projects, we use [warden](https://github.com/CorvusHold/warden).
